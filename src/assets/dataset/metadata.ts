        title: "About the Storm",
        description: "Cyclone Berly was a tropical cyclone that formed in the North Atlantic in 2023. It developed as part of the Atlantic hurricane season, bringing heavy rainfall, strong winds, and potential storm surges to affected regions. The storm intensified over warm ocean waters, though it remained relatively short-lived, causing localized impacts rather than widespread devastation. Detailed tracking and forecast models monitored its progress, but Berly did not reach major hurricane status."
